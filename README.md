SubParser:

    SubParser is a string parser from the Shell project but slightly modified

File Structs:

    struct MetaData
        Struct holds metadata

    struct FileData
        Struct holds file bytes
        - This is written in the data section

These two structs contain the same content... Helps me differentiate
between loading a file or a directory:

    struct FileIndex
        Struct holds Filename and Index Number
        - This is stored in the data section of its
          current directory

    struct DirectoryIndex
        Struct holds DirectoryName and Index Number
        - This is stored in the data section of its
          current directory

Other Structs/Functions:

    struct IndexBlocks
        To Load MMAP

    struct DataBlocks
        To Load MMAP

    int findAndSetIndex(char* directoryName, int type)
        This is called to find free space in the filesystem
        and allocates it

    void createFile(char* filePath)
        This is used to create a file in the filesystem
        
    void createDir(char* directoryIndex)
        This is used to create a directory in the filesystem
    
    void* openFile(char* filePath)
        This function opens a specific file

    void closeFile(struct MetaData** fileMeta)
        This functions closes a specific file

    void deleteFile(struct MetaData* fileMeta)
        This function deletes a file from the filesystem
        - File must be opened before this function is called
    
    struct FileData* readFile(struct MetaData* fileMeta)
        This function reads a specific file

    void writeFile(struct MetaData* fileMeta, char* data)
        This function writes to a specific file
        - You may also append to the file by calling the
          function multiple times with new data each time

    void createFixedSizeFile(int totalBlocks, int numberOfBlocks, int numberOfIndices)
        This function creates a fixed size file and sets
        evey byte to '\0'

    void displayFileSystem()
        This function prints the entire filesystem
