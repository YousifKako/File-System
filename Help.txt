Type 0: File
Type 1: Directory
Pointer -1: Data block is NOT capped... Nothing to Point too
Pointer (# > 0): Data block IS capped... Pointes to the extended index
Offset (# >= 0): This indicates where I may start reading or writing data from/to a data block
Index Number (# >= 0): Which index this metadata is in

Everything in this filesystem should work accordingly, I have setup for you
some examples in the code which should cover everything; you MAY comment-out
function calls and also add-in function calls (just make sure to call them
in a sensible order).

You may also change the following defines to any numbers you want
#define MAX_FILE_SIZE
#define DATA_BLOCK_SIZE
#define INDEX_BLOCK_SIZE

Capping a data block:
If a data block is capped, the program allocates a new index and data block
and sets the pointer to the new index
